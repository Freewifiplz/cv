    I am Navid Alvey, a rising sophomore majoring in <a href="https://cs.utdallas.edu/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/">University of Texas at Dallas</a> (UTD).
    Towards the end of my highschool career and the first year here at UTD I have been studying coding and programming
    with various different programming languages such as <em>HTML, CSS, and C++</em>.

    <br>

    In my past exeperiences I have worked on projects using these languages and more; such as <em>MATLAB</em> and
    <em>TinkerCAD</em> when was I was undergoing
    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/stem/High_School_Aerospace_Scholars.html">NASA's HAS program</a>.
    Mastering various coding languages and frameworks - such as <em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and NodeJS</em> -
    are just a a few of my plans that I have this summer. Getting atuned to working with these languages and frameworks
    will open my doors to opportunities to establish myself into the tech industry with outstanding internships/work
    exeperience such as <em>EdgeLearning</em>.

    <br>
    <br>

    Outside of my academic work I have been greatly involved in the Greek community here at UTD, specifically
    committing myself to <a href="http://depsibeta.org/">Delta Epsilon Psi</a> (Depsi). Crossing into Depsi in the Fall of 2021, I quickly rose up
    the ranks from being Philanthropy Chair and improving the fraternity's relationship with our philanthropy,
    <a href="https://www.jdrf.org/"> Juvenial Diabetes Research Fund</a> (JDRF), to being the newly elected Secretary of the fraternity.
